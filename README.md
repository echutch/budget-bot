Budget Bot

Problem

Managing personal finances can be challenging, especially when it comes to tracking and categorizing transactions. Many users receive transaction notifications via email but struggle to keep track of their spending habits efficiently. Manually logging expenses can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

Solution

Budget Bot automates transaction tracking by integrating with users' email accounts to parse bank transaction notifications, categorize spending, and send SMS notifications for easy categorization. Users can review categorized transactions on a web app and export data for further analysis.
